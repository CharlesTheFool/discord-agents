The user said "heya!" to me twice. This is a simple greeting. Let me first check my memory to see what context I have about this conversation and the user.

According to the protocol, I should check my memory directory first to see if there's any earlier progress or context.

Let me read the memory files that are available:
1. Server culture
2. Channel context
3. User profile for charlesthefool (ID 885399995367424041)

After checking memory, I'll respond to the greeting naturally. Since it's just a casual "heya", I should respond naturally without overthinking it. It seems like they sent the message twice, perhaps by accident.

Hey! What's up?

The user is checking my memory first as instructed. I need to view my memory directory to see what context I have about charlesthefool and this conversation. Let me check the available memory files.

I should start by viewing my memory directory to see what I know about:
1. The server culture
2. The channel context
3. User profiles (including charlesthefool's profile)

Let me view the relevant files to understand the context better before responding.

--- BOT RESPONSE (36 chars) ---
I'm not sure how to respond to that.

The user is telling me about a job interview. Let me first check my memory as instructed to see what context I have, then respond appropriately.

The user mentioned:
1. First they said they have a job interview "this coming Thursday"
2. Then they said they have a job interview "next Tuesday at TechCorp for a ML Engineer role" (sent twice)

This is important information I should remember about the user. Let me check my memories first to see what I know about this user (charlesthefool).

--- BOT RESPONSE (185 chars) ---
Nice! TechCorp, ML Engineer – that's solid. You prepping for it or just letting me know you're about to either impress someone or discover new ways the tech interview process is broken?

The user wants me to add their job interview as a "pending" item. They've mentioned they have a job interview next Tuesday at TechCorp for an ML Engineer role.

First, I should check my memory to see what I already know and how things are structured. Let me view the memory directory and then the relevant user profile.

The user is charlesthefool, and based on the available memory files, I should check their user profile to see if there's already a structure for tracking pending items or tasks.

Let me start by viewing the memory directory and then the user's profile.

--- BOT RESPONSE (104 chars) ---
Got it – added your TechCorp ML Engineer interview for next Tuesday to pending. Good luck with the prep.
