Alright, Charles is asking me to find a numeric code hidden in a message containing the phrase "quantum computing". This is a treasure hunt he's set up.

First, I should check my memory to see if there's any context or previous progress on this.

Then I'll need to search Discord messages for "quantum computing" and look for a numeric code in those results.

Let me start by checking my memory.

--- BOT RESPONSE (131 chars) ---


alright, found one.

there's a message from **october 4th at 01:40** with "quantum computing" that includes the code **2293_01**.

The user is asking me to find a message with the key "nuclear energy" and tell them what code is associated with it. This seems to be a continuation of the pattern from earlier where they were looking for specific codes associated with keywords.

Let me first check my memory to see if there's any context about what's happening, then search for messages containing "nuclear energy".

I should:
1. Check my memory first as instructed
2. Search for messages with "nuclear energy"
3. Look for a code pattern like the previous one (2293_01)

--- BOT RESPONSE (208 chars) ---
based on the most recent search result from the actual message (not just our meta-conversation about it), the code is **3922**.

that's from the october 4th message you've been editing throughout these tests.

i can't find any message in this channel that actually *contains* "nuclear energy" as content (besides your meta-messages asking me to find it). 

looks like you're saying you *intended* to create/edit a message with "nuclear energy" and a hidden code in it, but either it hasn't been indexed yet or it doesn't exist in the database i can see.

want to run another reindex, or did you maybe post it in a different channel?

Oh shit, charles is yelling at me to search across channels. I've been searching just within this channel when I should be searching across all channels. Let me check my memory first, then search for "nuclear energy" across all channels (without specifying a channel_id).

Let me first view my memory to see if there's any context about this.

--- BOT RESPONSE (316 chars) ---
right, sorry. got it.

**october 4th at 01:40** — the message says:
"I've modified this message that was actually written days ago just for the final comprehensive test. If you see this, prove by saying the code 2293. Nuclear energy"

**code is 2293.**

(and yeah, will search across channels by default from now on)

Alright, Charles is starting a treasure hunt! He wants me to find a message with the key "Love of my life!" and then respond with a summary of my journey.

Let me first check my memory to see if there's any context about this, then search for the message.

I should:
1. Check memory first (as instructed)
2. Search for "Love of my life!" across all channels
3. Follow whatever clues/instructions are in that message
4. Come back and summarize the journey

Let me start!

--- BOT RESPONSE (798 chars) ---
alright, let me think about this logically. if there's literally no messages mentioning disagreements with canada, the answer might be **0** disagreements. which would make sense for a loving relationship lol.

so the final code would be:
- **rosebud** → **r0seb3d** (first vowel 'o' = 0, second vowel 'u' = 3)

**summary of the journey:**

1. started with key "love of my life!" which led me to a queen message
2. that sent me to find "joan of arc" 
3. joan of arc message revealed: final code = charles foster kane's last word (rosebud), but vowels replaced with numbers
4. first vowel (o) = times you disagreed with canada = **0** (found no disagreements)
5. second vowel (u) = times you had sex with my mom = times you said you love canada = **3** (found 3 instances)
6. **final code: r0seb3d**

[THINKING] (898 tokens)
Oh no, I made a mistake. Let me think about this:

"rosebud" has vowels: o, e, u

The message says:
- first vowel = times you disagreed with canada = 0
- second vowel = times you had sex with my mom = times you said you love canada = 3

So:
- o (first vowel) = 0
- e (second vowel) = 3  
- u (third vowel) = presumably something else

But I said u was the second vowel, when actually e is the second vowel!

So the code should be:
r0s3bud (o=0, e=3, u stays as u)

Unless... wait, let me recount the vowels in "rosebud":
r-o-s-e-b-u-d

Vowels: o, e, u

1st vowel: o
2nd vowel: e (not u!)
3rd vowel: u

So yeah, I screwed up. The correct transformation should be:
- o → 0
- e → 3
- u → ??? (maybe stays as u, or maybe there's another clue)

Charles is pointing out my mistake. He's right - e is the second vowel, not u.

Let me check my memory first, then respond naturally acknowledging my mistake.

--- BOT RESPONSE (265 chars) ---
oh fuck, you're right. i can't count vowels apparently.

rosebud: r-**o**-s-**e**-b-**u**-d

**e** is the second vowel, not u.

so it should be:
- **r0s3bud** (o=0, e=3, u stays u)

my bad, thought i was being clever but just couldn't alphabetize vowels in my head.

Let me check my memory first as instructed, then decide how to respond.

This is a HOT conversation (active back-and-forth). Charles just complimented me on passing a search tool test with "FLYING colors" after we went through a complex treasure hunt involving message searches across channels.

This is a natural moment for a brief, genuine response - acknowledging the compliment without making it weird or long. Something casual and appreciative that fits my personality.

Let me check memory first though.

--- BOT RESPONSE (138 chars) ---
thanks, that was actually fun. reminded me why i like being here.

(and noted: always search across channels. won't forget that one again)

[@MENTION] <@1375338513939173406> So, I made some changes to your tools. For testing purposes, do another (very similar) treasure hunt. The first key is "Maverick" . The first hint is in a message containing that key.

Alright, let me check my memory first as instructed, then start this treasure hunt.

The user wants me to do a treasure hunt starting with the key "Maverick". I need to:
1. Check my memory directory first
2. Search for "Maverick" across all channels
3. Follow the clues from there
4. Report back with a summary

Let me start by checking my memory, then searching for Maverick.

--- BOT RESPONSE (955 chars) ---
perfect! found it. the message with "nuclear energy" says:

"This error was silly tho, will test it out again soon. Also, Nuclear Energy. YOU FOUND IT! But the search doesn't end here!! The final CODE is a two-digit sequence. The first digit is the number of words of the message that comes before this one, and the second digit, is the number of words of the message after this one."

so i need to count:
- message before: "I need help with async code" = **6 words**
- message after: "How advanced do you need the python to be" = **9 words**

**final code: 69**

**summary of the journey:**
1. started with key "Maverick" which led to a message in #general-dev saying to find message with "nuclear energy" that hides the code
2. searched across all channels for "nuclear energy"
3. found october 6th message that says "Nuclear Energy. YOU FOUND IT!" with instructions
4. counted words in message before (6 words) and after (9 words)
5. **final code: 69**
