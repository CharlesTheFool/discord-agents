2025-10-12 17:58:36,566 [INFO] core.reactive_engine:     Text preview: oh fuck, you're right. i can't count vowels apparently.

rosebud: r-**o**-s-**e**-b-**u**-d

**e** is the second vowel, not u.

so it should be:
- **r0s3bud** (o=0, e=3, u stays u)

my bad, thought i was being clever but just couldn't alphabetize vowels in my head.
