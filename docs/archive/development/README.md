# Development Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical development documentation from the framework's build process.

---

## PROJECT_SPEC.md

**Status:** Archived (Superseded)

**Original Purpose:** Complete development specification covering the framework's design and implementation across four development phases (Phases 1-4).

**Content:**
- Phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Technical requirements and specifications
- Feature definitions and success criteria
- Testing strategies
- Development timeline

**Why Archived:**
The framework has transitioned from active development phases to production-ready versioning (v0.4.0-beta). The phase-based approach was useful during development but has been superseded by:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Current technical reference
   - System design and component documentation
   - Use-case flows
   - Data models
   - Integration points

2. **[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history and roadmap
   - Semantic versioning (v0.1.0 â†’ v0.4.0-beta)
   - Release notes and features
   - Known issues
   - Future plans

**Historical Value:**
- Understanding design decisions and evolution
- Reference for original requirements
- Context for why certain features exist
- Learning resource for framework architecture
