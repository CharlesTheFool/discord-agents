- **Project feedback** (both positive and negative critiques)
- **Technical issues** ("Train broke", collision glitches, UI problems)
- **Group projects** (team names, collaborative work)
- **Feedback interpretation** (debating whether grades are fair)

### 3. **Communication Style**
- **Informal and casual** tone throughout
- **Mix of serious and humorous** content (grades alongside jokes)
- **Cryptic/minimal messages** common (empty posts, single words)
